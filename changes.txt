== [ Release 3 - 2024/07/23] ===================================================

- Added some bars at the bottom of the screen showing channel output levels by
  simulating the ADSR rates.  There are a few edge cases where it isn't accurate
  but overall it provides a good approximation.
- Slightly better representation of percussion mode - the note-on indicators
  light up now, and change to a ! symbol to show they are percussion.  This will
  likely be expanded later to a dedicated percussion mode display of some kind.
- Fixed 4-op channel display - all 6 channels that were capable of 4-op were 
  shown combined, even if only a single channel had the 4-op flag enabled.
- Channels display in numerical order if 4-op mode is off.
- Struggle bus mode fixed to not leave an empty channel table on screen - this
  was a mistake introduced when reworking the drawing code.  It also now leaves
  the system in 80x25 text mode instead of unnecessarily switching to 80x50.
- Under the hood, the source code has been restructured.  It has been split out
  from a single gigantic file, and now has a proper build system!  Rejoice!

== [ Release 2 - 2024/05/18] ===================================================

- Rewrote screen update code to only write screen areas when the actual chip
  data changes instead of refreshing the whole thing.  Performance is only
  marginally better overall, but it is much more responsive on under-specced
  systems.
- OPL2 detection now actually works outside of emulation.
- Disabled interrupt timer mistakenly left on while decompressing VGZs, now it
  completes a lot faster.
- Improved handling of VGMs that are missing "end of song data" command (0x66)
- Fixed a mistake in sample position calculation; all commands advanced the
  position counter even if there were multiple commands in one sample.  This may
  have been a contributing factor to the DIVIDER configuration setting making
  complicated VGMs sound weird, so setting a higher DIVIDER should be less of a
  problem now!
- Fixed issue where playlist entries would fail to load on some systems.
- Fixed OPL register/data write delays being reversed.
- Error messages related to file loading are more descriptive.

== [ Release 1 - 2024/05/05] ===================================================

The very first public release of VGMSlap!

Implements my original planned feature set to the current extent of my ability:

- Plays VGM and VGZ files that use OPL1, OPL2, 2xOPL2, and OPL3
- ASCII channel visualization
- GD3 tag support
- Playlist support
