## Building

VGMSlap is written with **Open Watcom C 2.0** in mind.  Assuming you have your Watcom environment variables and PATH set correctly, just run **wmake**.

## Licenses

The VGMSlap software and code itself is licensed under the **MIT License** (see LICENSE).

This VGMSlap source distribution also incorporates a prebuilt zlib 1.2.11, the last version I could get to successfully compile for DOS on Watcom, which is licensed under the **zlib license** (see zlib/LICENSE).
